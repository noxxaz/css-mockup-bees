# Matching Mockups #001: Busy Bees

## Table

In this activity, you'll be creating a simple 3-column table. You should aim to make your version look as identical as possible to the provided version. Matching the given mockups with absolute 100% accuracy is not expected, however, you should prioritize the objectives listed below.

# Basic Objectives

- Create a table with multiple rows and columns.
  - The top header row should list the name of each column, and should be a different color from the other rows.
  - Every 2nd row should have a slightly darker background color. Use a CSS `pseudo-class` to achieve this.
  - The bottom row of the table should have a slightly thicker border bottom. Use a CSS `pseudo-class` to achieve this.
  - When the user hovers over a row, its background color should change.

# Fonts Used

The following fonts are available via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):

- **Arvo** - used for headers
- **Lato** - used for the rest of the page content
